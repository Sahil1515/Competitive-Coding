
Transitive Closure of a Graph 
	i)using Warshall Floyd O(n3)
	ii)using DFS O(n3)
	

TRAVERSAL:

1) DFS 
2) BFS


3) Topological sort
4) Detect cycle in Directed Graph

MINIMUM SPANNING TREE:

5) Prim's Algorithm
6) Kruskal's Algorithm

STRONGLY CONNECTED COMPONENTS:

7) Kosaraju's Algo 

DISTANCE ALGORITHMS:

8) Floyd Warshall Algo :
		--Shortest distance between all nodes to other nodes
		--O(V^3)
9) Dijksta's Algorithm
		--Shortest path betwwen given point to all other nodes
		--Solved using Greedy
		--Can work on directed as well as non-directed graphs
		--O(Vlog(V))
		--Only positives edges
10)Bellman Ford 
		--Shortest path betwwen given point to all other nodes
		--Solved using DP
		--The Bellman-Ford algorithm works on directed graphs.
		  To make it work with undirected graphs we must make each 
		  undirected edge into two directed edges (one in each direction) 
		  with the same weights as the original undirected edge.
		--Negative edges also 
		--If there is negative weighted cycle , then the graph can't be solved
		--O(VE) :if the graph is complete then E= V*V so O(V^3)
