Program for nth Catalan Number
Last Updated: 22-09-2020

Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.
1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
4) Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
See this for more applications. 
The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …
